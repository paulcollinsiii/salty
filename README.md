What Changed
------------

Mainly I got sick of fighting with salt every time it upgraded in Arch. Yeah I
know that's part of the fun, but I'm done fighting with it. Moving over to
Ansible in the hopes that I can stop fighting a system to manage what I feel
are basic packages and config on my machines
