Expectations
------------
Ansible is going to be my solution going forward. This repo will slowly remove
all the salt stack and replace it with Ansible equivalents.

My environments have changed as well. My primary home-project dev env is now a
Raspberry Pi 400, because kiddos and blinky lights means "Hey coding can be
fun!" That and making it safe for her to experiment but for me to recover to a
reasonable starting point is helpful.


Historical Context
------------------
This repo started out as a Salt experiment to control a Razer laptop from 2017
to spin up Arch Linux, as well as Mac for work. Early on there were a lot of
quirks both with the Razer and trying to run Arch on it. This was an exercise
in both patience and willingness to Google all kinds of firmware / hardware
quirks, especially for ZFS on root. Said laptop now runs Windows 10, because
Kerbal and that's it. The Mac was no longer my problem as I changed jobs.
There was also a point in time I decided to automate a FreeBSD machine which
still acts as a tertiary backup for all my photos. At this point Raspberry Pi
400 is how I experiment with IoT toys and intro my daughter to coding in
general.

My dotfiles are important to me because neovim, tmux and the terminal are my
primary methods of coding in general. Thus oh-my-zsh / oh-my-bash and making
the terminal pretty are super nice to haves. Fighting this setup every time
is... annoying. DevOps / SRE is in my career history thus automating all the
things!

If someone else happens to find these kind of things useful please drop me a
line. I'd love to hear from you and know how you've used this.
